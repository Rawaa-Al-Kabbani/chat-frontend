# Chat app

Backend: https://github.com/Rawaa-Al-Kabbani/chat-backend

This is my implementation of the frontend for the Chat app. It is written in Typescript and React.js is used as the framework.

When running the app via Docker Nginx is used to serve the static build files.

You can currently sign up, sign in, create room, and send messages in the app.

The app uses WebSockets for real-time room and message updates.

## Requirements

- Node.js and Yarn for running the app locally.
  If you are using NVM you can install a compatible version from the `.nvmrc` file using `nvm use`
- Docker for running the app via Docker
- docker-compose for running the app via docker-compose
